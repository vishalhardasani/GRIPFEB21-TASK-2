# GRIPFEB21-TASK-2
My second task as an intern in The Spark Foundation I have imported all the necessary libraries and then using the 'Elbow Method' i found out the cluster. And then i using Kmean i fitted the model and then using a Scatter plot i visualized it using different colours for different centroids.
